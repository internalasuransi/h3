# Authentication Module Documentation

## Overview

This module handles the user login and signup interface. It uses a toggle mechanism to switch between the Login and Signup forms without reloading the page.

## Files

- **`public/index.html`**: Contains the HTML structure for both Login and Signup forms.
- **`public/css/auth.css`**: Styles specific to the auth pages, overriding `base_global.css`.
- **`public/js/auth.js`**: Handles the form toggling and submit events (currently placeholders for Firebase integration).

## Change Log
